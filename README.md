Implemented Methodology: We implemented the waterfall methodology, which is a project development approach that is based on the linear sequence of stages, where each stage is completed before moving to the next. Although it is mostly implemented in software development projects, it was adapted to this FoodFusionU project.

Definition of requirements: In this stage, the team clearly identifies and documents all the requirements and objectives of the project, this includes defining the main characteristics of the platform and the services that will be offered and the needs of the users.
Design: Once the requirements are established, the team must move to the design phase. Here a detailed platform design is created that includes the platform architecture, user interface, main functionalities and any integration with external systems. ANALYSIS AND DESIGN OF SYSTEMS

Implementation: With the complete design, the platform begins to be developed; this involves the creation of the necessary technological infrastructure and the coding of the functionalities and the integration of the system components.
Evidence: After implementation it is important to perform extensive testing to ensure that the platform works as intended, this includes functionality, performance and usability testing.
Deployment: Once the tests are satisfactory and the platform is ready for use, the deployment proceeds, which involves launching the platform and making it accessible to users.
Operation and maintenance: Once the platform is operational, an ongoing operation and maintenance process must be established. This includes server administration, performance monitoring, bug fixes, and implementation of improvements.
Evaluation and Feedback: As the FoodFusionU platform is used, it is important to collect feedback from users and evaluate their performance. This information is used to make improvements and adjustments in future versions of the platform. Important: The waterfall methodology is linear and sequential, so each stage must be completed before moving to the next.
