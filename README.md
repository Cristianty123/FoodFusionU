FoodFusionU
FoodFusionU is a platform designed to make every meal an exciting adventure, whether you're interested in vegetarian options, exotic dishes, or simply trying something new. Our platform offers a curated list of meals tailored to your preferences, allowing you to explore a wide variety of cuisines and discover surprising flavors.

Technologies Used
Java: FoodFusionU is developed using Java, ensuring platform independence and suitability for various environments.

Eclipse Java Developers: The project is designed to work seamlessly with the Eclipse Java Developers IDE, providing a powerful development environment.

Methodology
We follow the waterfall methodology for the development of FoodFusionU, a project development approach based on a linear sequence of stages, where each stage is completed before moving to the next. While this methodology is commonly used in software development projects, we've adapted it to the FoodFusionU project.

Stage 1: Definition of Requirements
In this stage, we clearly identify and document all the requirements and objectives of the project. This includes defining the main characteristics of the platform, the services it will offer, and the needs of our users.

Stage 2: Design
Once the requirements are established, we move to the design phase. Here, we create a detailed platform design that includes the platform architecture, user interface, main functionalities, and any integration with external systems.

Stage 3: Implementation
With the complete design, the platform development begins. This involves the creation of the necessary technological infrastructure, coding of the functionalities, and integration of system components.

Stage 4: Testing
After implementation, we conduct extensive testing to ensure that the platform works as intended. This includes functionality, performance, and usability testing.

Stage 5: Deployment
Once the tests are satisfactory, and the platform is ready for use, we proceed with deployment, which involves launching the platform and making it accessible to users.

Stage 6: Operation and Maintenance
Once the platform is operational, we establish an ongoing operation and maintenance process. This includes server administration, performance monitoring, bug fixes, and implementation of improvements.

Stage 7: Evaluation and Feedback
As the FoodFusionU platform is used, we collect feedback from users and evaluate their experiences.
